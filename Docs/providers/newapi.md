# New API

| `Provider` | Ring name | Host | Icon |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.newAPI` | New API | **whatever the reader types** | `newapi` |

Service: [`../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/NewAPIUsageService.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/NewAPIUsageService.swift). Address rules, shared with [sub2api.md](sub2api.md): [`../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/GatewayAddress.swift`](../../Sources/Pulse/Providers/GatewayAddress.swift).

[New API](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api) is the gateway most self-run relays are actually built on — a fork line going back to one-api — so this is the broadest single thing Pulse can read in this class. The credential is the ordinary `sk-` key already in the reader's AI client; there is no second one to go and find.

**Upstream terms are the operator's business.** Pulse reads accounting from a deployment the reader already has a key for and takes no view on how that deployment got its capacity.

## Not verified against a live deployment

No New API instance was run for this. Everything below is read off the project's own source at `QuantumNous/new-api` — `router/dashboard.go`, `controller/billing.go`, `controller/misc.go`, `setting/operation_setting/general_setting.go` — and the fixtures under `Tests/PulseTests/Fixtures/newapi-*.json` are written to those shapes. Nothing here claims a runtime test.

## Three routes, run together

```
GET {root}/v1/dashboard/billing/subscription    Authorization: Bearer sk-…
GET {root}/v1/dashboard/billing/usage           Authorization: Bearer sk-…
GET {root}/api/status                           (no credential)
```

```json
{ "object": "billing_subscription", "has_payment_method": true,
  "soft_limit_usd": 25.5, "hard_limit_usd": 25.5,
  "system_hard_limit_usd": 25.5, "access_until": 0 }

{ "object": "list", "total_usage": 1234.5 }

{ "success": true, "data": { "quota_display_type": "USD",
                             "display_in_currency": true,
                             "system_name": "Example Relay" } }
```

The first two are OpenAI's own billing paths, which is the whole reason this is readable: New API implements them for compatibility, and `middleware.TokenAuth` accepts the relay key. `401` on a bad key, so status handling is ordinary. The third is the site's public configuration — nothing in it is account-scoped, so it is **not** given the key.

Three concurrent requests every 2–30 minutes. The status route is asked every pass rather than cached, so an operator changing the display setting is picked up rather than remembered wrongly.

## Neither figure means what its name says

| Field | Name suggests | Actually |
|---|---|---|
| `hard_limit_usd` | a ceiling | `remaining + used` — everything the key has ever had |
| `total_usage` | an amount | the amount **times a hundred** (OpenAI reported cents) |
| `*_usd` | dollars | whatever unit the operator set |

So:

```
remaining = hard_limit_usd − total_usage / 100
```

Both sides are New API's own numbers, so the subtraction is arithmetic on reported figures rather than an inference. **The factor of a hundred is the trap**: read as units, a wallet with $13 left comes out at −$1,209, which is a full red ring and a notification announcing an account as spent. `NewAPIParsingTests` pins it.

## No percentage is drawn

`used / (remaining + used)` looks like a ring and is not one, because that denominator is two unrelated things depending on a **server** setting that appears nowhere in the reply — `DisplayTokenStatEnabled`:

- **on** — the figures are the key's own. A key sold with a quota really does have that allowance, and the fraction would be exactly right.
- **off** — the figures are the *account's*, and `used` is lifetime. Somebody who has spent $900 over a year and just topped up $100 would be drawn at 90% spent with a full wallet, and every top-up would grow the denominator.

One reply, two meanings, no way to tell them apart. So this draws the money and no fraction — the rail shows the balance, the same as a [sub2api](sub2api.md) wallet and DeepSeek's `balanceOnly` ([deepseek.md](deepseek.md)). See [`README.md`](README.md#pulse-does-not-invent-a-percentage).

If anyone does want a ring here, the answer is to generalise DeepSeek's three-way `DeepSeekBasis` picker rather than to start dividing. That has deliberately not been done yet.

## The unit is not in the reply either

New API converts the amount into whatever its operator chose and keeps OpenAI's field name, so a CNY site reports yuan in `hard_limit_usd` and a TOKENS site reports a token count. `GET /api/status` carries the answer:

| `quota_display_type` | Pulse reports |
|---|---|
| `USD` | USD |
| `CNY` | CNY |
| `TOKENS` | **no money** — a token count is not a currency |
| `CUSTOM` | **no money** — an operator's own symbol is not an ISO code |
| absent, or anything else | **no money** |

**Nil rather than a default**, in every one of those rows. A display type added upstream that Pulse has not been taught must not be quietly priced in dollars, and a status route that did not answer is "cannot say" rather than "assume USD" — the reading then reports `.noLimitsReported` instead of putting a dollar sign on a number.

Older builds and one-api forks carry `display_in_currency` (a bool) instead. It distinguishes money from tokens and nothing more, so it is read only when `quota_display_type` is absent and can only ever answer USD — which is what the builds that carried it assumed.

## Unlimited keys

`controller/billing.go` substitutes a literal `100000000` for the amount when a key has `UnlimitedQuota` set, rather than setting a flag. So the sentinel is recognised **by value**, and only when all three of `hard_limit_usd`, `soft_limit_usd` and `system_hard_limit_usd` agree — they are written from one variable upstream, so agreement is what separates the sentinel from a deployment that really did sell somebody exactly that much.

An unlimited key reports `.noLimitsReported`, which is the literal truth and classes as `Standing.answered` for alerts. Computing `remaining` against the sentinel would have shown a hundred million of something.

## The address

Same trust boundary as [sub2api.md](sub2api.md), and the same code — `GatewayAddress`. https except on a private network, no user info, no fragment, no query, refused rather than upgraded. What differs is the suffix trimmed off whatever the reader typed: **`/v1`**, because people paste the base URL out of their AI client's config and for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that is where it ends. Trimming happens before the route is chosen, which is what keeps `/api/status` from landing under `/v1`.

The address is stored per account in `AppSettings.serverAddresses`, keyed by account id like `sources` and `sessionBrowsers`. It was a scalar while sub2api was the only gateway; a second one turned "the address" into "*whose* address", and a shape that cannot hold two is the shape that quietly gives one provider the other's host.

## Credential

The relay's `sk-` key, pasted into Settings and kept encrypted on this Mac by `APIKeyStore`. No discovery hint — a deployment is somebody else's server. The pane asks for the **address first and the key second**, because nothing can be sent anywhere until Pulse knows where.

## The mark

**Not the logo in New API's own web UI.** That one (`web/src/assets/logo.tsx`) is the command-key glyph, which is exactly what Command Code's mark already is — two rings a reader could not tell apart, which is the one thing a rail of logos must not do. The icon here is the project's brand logo (`web/public/logo.png`) reduced to a monochrome outline: two crescents and the spark between them. A reduction, not a trace — the original is a cyan-to-pink gradient and none of that survives a template image.

For the same reason `BotMarkTint.brand` gives it no colour: neither end of a gradient is "the" brand colour, so it takes one of Pulse's own.

## Not carried

- **`access_until`.** The key's expiry, 0 for none. There is no subscription-expiry row on the card for any provider yet.
- **`/api/user/self`**, which carries the account's own quota, groups and top-up history. It needs the console's web session, not the relay key — the same wall [deepseek.md](deepseek.md) hit, and the reason `providesHistory` is false.
- **Multiple keys.** `supportsMultipleAccounts` is false. Somebody with keys on three relays wants three rings; the account machinery and the per-account address would both carry it, but nobody has asked.
