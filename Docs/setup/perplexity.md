# Set up Perplexity in Pulse

Pulse shows the API credit on your Perplexity account as a dollar balance and, when your subscription's monthly credit is the only credit on the account, how much of it is used, as a ring with its renewal date.

## What you need

A Perplexity account, signed in to a browser at perplexity.ai.

## Steps

1. Sign in at [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) and open [your account's usage page](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/usage) once to check it shows your credit.
2. In Pulse: **Settings → Accounts → Perplexity**. Turn on **Show in panel**.
3. Under **Read from browser**, pick the browser you signed in with (or leave it on Automatic) and click **Read**.
   - Chrome, Edge, Brave and Arc: macOS asks once for Keychain permission.
   - Safari: give Pulse Full Disk Access first, in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
4. Within a few seconds the account's card shows the balance, and the ring if there is one.

**Why there may be no ring.** Perplexity reports each credit grant and the total used, but not which grant the usage came out of. With a bonus or bought credit on the account beside the subscription's, Pulse can't say how much of the subscription's is gone, so it shows the balance alone rather than guess.

## If it doesn't work

| Pulse says | What to do |
|---|---|
| Read a browser session in Settings. | Click **Read** under **Read from browser**. |
| No session found. Sign in at www.perplexity.ai first. | The browser has no Perplexity session. Sign in there, then click **Read** again. |
| The browser session expired. Sign in on the website, then read it again in Settings. | Sign in again at perplexity.ai, then click **Read** again. Perplexity's bot screen can also turn a request away this way; opening the site in the same browser and reading again usually helps. |
| The service didn't respond. / Checking too often — easing off. / The service returned an error. | A temporary network or server problem. Wait a moment and try again. |
| Couldn't read the reply. / No limits reported. | Perplexity sent something Pulse doesn't recognize, or reported no credit at all. |

## What Pulse reads

Pulse reads only Perplexity's sign-in cookie from your browser, stores it encrypted on this Mac, and sends it only to `www.perplexity.ai`, asking the same thing your account's usage page asks. It does not follow redirects, so the cookie never goes anywhere else.
