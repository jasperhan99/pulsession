# Set up Replicate in Pulse

Pulse shows the prepaid credit left on your Replicate account. Replicate reports no allowance or percentage, so there is no ring to fill — the balance is the reading.

## What you need

A Replicate account, signed in at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com) in a browser on this Mac. Your Replicate API token can't read billing, so it isn't used.

## Steps

1. Sign in at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com) in Safari, Chrome, Firefox or another browser on this Mac.
2. In Pulse: **Settings → Accounts → Replicate**. Turn on **Show in panel**.
3. Under **Connection**, next to **Read from browser**, pick the browser (or leave it on **Automatic**) and click **Read**. Chrome-family browsers may ask for Keychain access to their cookie store.
4. Within a few seconds the account shows its credit balance.

If you belong to an organization, Pulse reads whichever account Replicate's billing page opens on.

## If it doesn't work

| Pulse says | What to do |
|---|---|
| Read a browser session in Settings. | Do step 3. |
| No session found. Sign in at replicate.com first. | Sign in at replicate.com in the browser you picked, then click **Read** again. |
| The browser session expired. Sign in on the website, then read it again in Settings. | Sign in at replicate.com again, then click **Read**. |
| The service didn't respond. / Checking too often — easing off. / The service returned an error. | A temporary network or server problem. Wait a moment and try again. |
| Couldn't read the reply. | Replicate changed its billing page, and Pulse doesn't recognize it. |
| No limits reported. | Replicate didn't report a credit balance for this account. |

## What Pulse reads

Pulse keeps only replicate.com's `sessionid` and `csrftoken` cookies, stores them encrypted on this Mac, and sends them only to replicate.com: once for the billing page (to learn which account it is) and once for that account's credit balance.
